# Efficient-Information-Retrieval-from-Unstructured-Database-using-Advanced-Algorithm

The amount of information across the world is increasing day by day. Getting the relevant information related to a specific topic in minimum time is the goal of todayâ€™s efficient information retrieval systems and this is always being interest of the researchers. The information retrieval systems are getting efficient day by day. Here we proposed an efficient information retrieval system to get the relevant documents from the unstructured database using different page ranking algorithms. Different optimization techniques for relevant 
document searching based on the given query involve removing of the stopping word i.e. the most common occurring words in English language so that do no have a drastic impact on efficiency of our proposed system. Number of precomputations are performed before finding the
relevance score of a particular quey in set of documents. This will ultimately minimize the time for searching the relevant documents from the large databases.
